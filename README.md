# LowCapacitanceProbe
1+ GHz AC Probe with low input capacitance (< 1 pF, hopefully)
Forked from FETProbe_V2 by makerprobe which is an improved fork of crteensy's FETProbe_tiny. This project will try to make some usability improvements as well as ability to use higher frequency transistor CF-739 (different bias, could extend bandwidth to 2 GHz). U.fl connectors will probably be replaced by something a bit more sturdy (and each connector will be different). Contacts will probably be modified to allow soldering fixed needle for the input and pogo pin (maybe rotatable) for ground.
